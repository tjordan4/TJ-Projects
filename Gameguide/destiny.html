      <p>Destiny 2 up to this point has been a widely acclaimed and widely criticized game. From the way that it was run and maintained while it was owned by Blizzard/Activision to when they went independent and then making a partnership with Sony, this game has been through the gambit. </p>
      <p>There are many people who hate it and there are many people who love it. Though I am one of those who love it, I will be as unboased as I can.</p>

      <h2>Visuals</h2>

      <p>Visually, this game is pretty good.</p>
      <p>Looking at the art and environment in the game you really do feel like you are in another world, or rather the future, since the setting is future Earth. It is more when you start interacting and fighting the alien races on planets and places other than Earth that the visuals really shine. </p>
      <p>As of writing this article there are several alien races and alien cultures that you run into. in design and look both them and their technology are vastly different in appearance. Not only that but within the different races you can also see that there are different factions easily in the races.</p>
      <p>The weapons and armor that you as a character use are also prety high quality. This is especially true when you take into account that there are ways to change the colors of your armor and weapons. These "shaders" are very diverse. There are more recently even "shaders" where the pattern moves over time. </p>
      <p>The main reason that I gave visuals the score that I did was because of the texturing of certain things. For example, the plantlife looks like it was produced a few years before the actual release. As well, it is kind of weird when you running along, nothing is in your path, but you get stuck. 
        On occasion the boundaries of the wall and such things are beyond where they look like they are. Not to mention sometimes when you run into these areas, you did randomly and for no reason.</p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>

      <p>The gameplay in Destiny 2 is quite diverse. There are a few aspects to look at here. Among them are gunplay, abilities, and interacting with the world.</p>
      <p>The gunplay here is very good. many weapons feel very good to shoot and if you have a weapon that you dont like even of a certain archetype (i.e. auto-rifles, pulse rifles, sidearms, grenade launcher, etc.) there is more than likely one that does fit your style. 
        Every weapon has a set number of "rolls" that they can have. This includes perks one the weapon and things like fire-rate, their range, and reload speed. There is even now a mechanic that allows you to craft weapons that you have unlocked and then level them up.
        as you level up a weapon more of those perks assigned to randomly roll in the weapon become available to you. And you can also get an upgraded version of perks once you level the weapon up enough and spend enough resources. </p>
      <p>The negative part of the gunplay is that there are fixes and balancing in each patch. While some of these are good. other completely ruin the weapon in terms of usability.</p>
      <p>Now for abilities!</p>
      <p>There are three distinct classes in Destiny 2. They are Titan, Warlock, and Hunter. There abilites pretty much match what you think when you think of those things outside of this game. The Titan is a big old front and center leading the charge type, while the Warlock is more squishy, but has effective and powerful ranged abilities. The Hunter class is where you might see more deviation. Hunters are more scout-like. Their main thing is their ability to move around the battlefield and be destructive while doing it.</p>
