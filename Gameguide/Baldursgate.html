      <p>Baldur's gate is a nerds dream,especially if you are into Dungeons and Dragons or high fantasy.  There are many reasons why it won Game of the Year for 2023</p>
      
      <h2>Visuals</h2>
      
      <p>The visuals of the game are extremely good. There is breathtaking scenery, and the overall graphics are great. I attribute this to why at times my PC took so long to load the game.</p>
      <p>However, that is a negative. My computer is decently speced. It is not top of the line but it is pretty good. It should not take that long.</p> 
      <p>As well, on occasion I would kill and enemy or be looking around and the camera would zoom in to where I couldnt see anything and I had to fast-travel or mess around with moving the camer to get back to where I could see again.</p>
     
      <h2>Gameplay</h2>

      <p>This game was amazing to play. I personally an not huge on turn based games when I do video games. But this game made enjoyable and even turned it into a puzzle for me.</p>
      <p>There were so many different ways of going through combat that it was never a dull moment. And with the leveling system it made it even better.</p>
      <p>Though the combat was engaging and fun it wasnt necessary for everything. There were choices to be made and altogether way too many ways of ultimately getting to your end goal.</p>
      <p>According to one article I read there were apporximately 1700 different endings for BG3. This is due to all the different choices. Each one has a lasting impression and changes the course of the story in some way.</p>
      <p>But the number of choices did make it a bit overwhelming when almost every conversation had a game changing choice to be made.</p>

      <h2>Story</h2>

      <p>Though the many choices detracts a bit from the gameplay aspect, it is made up for in the story.</p>
      <p>The choices make the story intriguing and engaging.</p>
