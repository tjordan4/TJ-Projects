    <div class="review">
      <p>Baldur's gate is a nerds dream, especially if you are into Dungeons and Dragons or high fantasy.  There are many reasons why it won Game of the Year for 2023</p>
      
      <h2>Visuals</h2>
      
      <p>The visuals of the game are extremely good. There is breathtaking scenery, and the overall graphics are great. I attribute this to why at times my PC took so long to load the game.</p>
      <p>However, that is a negative. My computer is decently speced. It is not top of the line but it is pretty good. It should not take that long.</p> 
      <p>As well, on occasion I would kill and enemy or be looking around and the camera would zoom in to where I couldnt see anything and I had to fast-travel or mess around with moving the camer to get back to where I could see again.</p>
     
      <h2>Gameplay</h2>

      <p>This game was amazing to play. I personally an not huge on turn based games when I do video games. But this game made enjoyable and even turned it into a puzzle for me.</p>
      <p>There were so many different ways of going through combat that it was never a dull moment. And with the leveling system it made it even better.</p>
      <p>Though the combat was engaging and fun it wasnt necessary for everything. There were choices to be made and altogether way too many ways of ultimately getting to your end goal.</p>
      <p>According to one article I read there were apporximately 1700 different endings for BG3. This is due to all the different choices. Each one has a lasting impression and changes the course of the story in some way.</p>
      <p>But the number of choices did make it a bit overwhelming when almost every conversation had a game changing choice to be made.</p>

      <h2>Story</h2>

      <p>Though the many choices detracts a bit from the gameplay aspect, it is made up for in the story.</p>
      <p>The choices make the story intriguing and engaging. It also makes it so that as long as you don't make the same choices each time you play there are new things happening and sometimes you get new cutscenes.</p>
      <p>It is also quite different playing as a newly made charcater versus playing one of the origin characters. There is even a origin character called The Dark Urge that you dont get to experience unless you are playing them.</p>
      <p>If you want to go through and find as many side quests and such as you want. Or you are able to just almost plow through the main storyline, though you might have some trouble since you might not have the levels and abilities you need to make things easier.</p>

      <h2>Replay-ability</h2>

      <p>As mentioned in the story section above there are so many choices in this game it is ridiculous. Each choice can make a world of difference. Once while playing with my girlfriend, she got a cutscene with the origin character Shadowheart that I didn't get in my playthrough where I was romancing her.</p>
      <p>My first playthrough of the game I actually didn't end up fighting the endgame boss because of the choices I made. So now I am replaying again so that can fight the endgame boss and see what happens when that happens.</p>
      <p>Whenever I play, I tend to be a good person with my choices or make the "moral" choices. But the purpose I have seen so far the the Dark Urge origin character I mentioned perviously, it's purpose is for when people want to do an "evil" play through.</p>

      <h2>Overall Impression</h2>

      <p>Overall, Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best games I have played in a long time. It was extremely fun and engaging.</p>
      <p>As stated previously, there were a couple things that I didn't like (i.e., the loading time), but the positives of this game vastly outweigh the negatives.</p>
      <p>With how many options and different ways to go through the game, and with the sheer ability to customize your character there is something here for everyone.</p>
